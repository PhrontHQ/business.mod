# Process

## Process Focus on Standardization and Repeatability:

- "Process" emphasizes a standardized, repeatable set of activities designed to achieve a specific outcome. Itâ€™s more about the rules, steps, and procedures than the flow of work.
- Example: "The process for approving tooling SOWs involves three steps: review, cost analysis, and sign-off."

- a process highlights the structured steps required to complete a task.


- Process describes procedures, policies, or methodologies (e.g., "the hiring process," "the quality control process").
- Process focuses on how things should be done rather than the sequence of tasks.


## Key Difference with a Workflow:

- Workflow: Describes phases, sequences, or task progression. "How does the work move from start to finish?"

- Process:  Describes standardized procedures, rules, or methodologies. "What are the standardized steps to complete this task?"
