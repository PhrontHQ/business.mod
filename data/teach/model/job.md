# JobRole's Responsibilities

- Example: "Her responsibilities include designing dashboards, analyzing trends, and presenting insights to stakeholders."

  - Often listed in job descriptions or performance reviews.
  - Can vary even within the same job title (e.g., two "Marketing Managers" might have different responsibilities).

# Example in Practice:

- Job: "Product Manager"
- Role: "Product Manager for the Mobile App Team"
- Responsibilities:
  - "Define the product roadmap."
  - "Collaborate with designers and engineers."
  - "Analyze user feedback."


- Job: A generic title or category (e.g., "Software Engineer").
- A "Software Engineer" (job) might fill different roles like:

    - Frontend Engineer (role focused on UI/UX).
    - Backend Engineer (role focused on server-side logic).
        - A Backend Engineer Role could have the following responsibilities:
            - Design and implement scalable APIs
            - Optimize database performance
            - Collaborate with frontend engineers to integrate systems
            - Write and maintain unit and integration tests
            - Debug and resolve backend issues

    - DevOps Engineer (role focused on infrastructure).







Why?

Roles adapt the job to team needs, projects, or specializations.
One person might even switch roles within the same job (e.g., moving from frontend to backend).
