# Workflow

## Workflow Phases:

a workflow phase refers to a distinct stage or segment of a workflow that represents a group of related tasks or activities. Phases help break down complex workflows into manageable, logical steps and often align with milestones, timelines, or organizational processes.

### What Is a Workflow Phase?

A workflow phase is:

- A high-level stage in a workflow (e.g., "Planning," "Execution," "Review").
- A group of related tasks that share a common goal or output.
- Often tied to timelines, deliverables, or approvals (e.g., "Phase 1: Feasibility Study").
- Used to track progress and organize work (e.g., "Weâ€™re in the PS/PSC phase").

### Examples of Workflow Phases
